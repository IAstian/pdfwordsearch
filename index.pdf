hi there WWE
UPDATE: Good Humor’s WWE Superstars Cookie Sandwiches, a new take on the popular wrestling ice cream bars that were discontinued in 2009, are now available for home delivery in select cities around the country. And Nerdist got a chance to try them. Some might say we were way too excited about this, but those people obviously never had the originals. They were amazing. If you’re hoping to get the exact same experience from these new ones though you might be disappointed. But if you’re looking for a fantastic and satisfying treat you’re going to be very happy.

Their are two big differences between these new ice cream sandwiches and the old bars, one in flavor the other in texture. The old bars had a chocolate back. The sandwiches feature vanilla wafer cookies with a vanilla “frozen dairy dessert,” rather than actual ice cream. (That sounds like a bad thing but it’s not.) The flavor profile of the new sandwiches are a lot more one-note than the old bars were.

Also, the two vanilla wafer cookies are much softer than the old bar’s cookie was. (It’s been at least 11 years since we had the original, so we’re relying on our memory.) That creates a very different kind of bite. The old bars, which came on a stick, had that snap of classic ice cream bars. It was chewier. The new sandwiches are significantly lighter, and some of the vanilla wafer sticks to your fingers as you eat it. (Also, the wrestlers’ images are a lot fainter now but who cares.)
